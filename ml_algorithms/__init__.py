"""Collection of machine learning algorithms for Python, coded from scratch.

Collection of modules integrating classical machine learning algorithms. It is not intended that these algorithmss
match the complexity and rigour of well-known implementations, such as sci-kit learn. Instead these algorithms are
developed to facilitate a deeper understanding of the mechanics of commonly used statistical models. """
